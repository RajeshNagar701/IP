React Components
Components are independent and reusable bits of code. 
They serve the same purpose as 

JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.

Components come in two types, 
Class components and Function components, in this tutorial 
we will concentrate on Function components.

Class Component
A class component must include the extends React.Component statement. 
This statement creates an inheritance to React.Component, and gives your component access 
to React.Component's functions.

The component also requires a render() method, this method returns HTML.

1) class component

class Car extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
  }
}


2)Function Component
Here is the same example as above, but created using a Function component instead.

A Function component also returns HTML, and behaves much the same way as a Class component,
but Function components can be written using much less code, are easier to understand, and will be preferred in this tutorial.

function Car() {
  return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
}
